In order to plan my project, i used a Trello board. This is a good strategy, as they let you add extra detail to the cards and very visually see how far you are along the project.

I broke down every mechanic that I needed to complete based on the Game Design Document. Then, I started rationing out the tasks over the 4 weeks I had, including the writing tasks.
This was extremely helpful as it helped me know exactly what I needed to do at every time, and my work was spread evenly over the whole time I had.
