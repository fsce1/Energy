Green with Energy is a puzzle game in which you need to supply houses with energy using green solutions such as wind turbines and solar panels.
You need to think about different voltages, and the day-night cycle of energy.
For example, solar panels arent enough to power a house alone, as during the night they dont give off any power.
It also rewards efficiency in your plans as you have a budget and everything you place costs money.
