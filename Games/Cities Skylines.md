Cities: Skylines is a sandbox game about building your own city, similar to SimCity and Tropico.
However, it also makes you manage infrastructure such as energy, waste disposal and water pipes.
Citizens will become unhappy if they are placed too close to an industrial zone, or if they have no access to basic services. There is also a negative penalty for using fossil fuel power stations instead of green solutions.
