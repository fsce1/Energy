Factorio is a sandbox game in which you build massive factories using conveyor belts and automated technology. The main progression is a very large tech tree of more and more complicated automation features, such as conveyor splitters, insertion arms, worker robots, logistic robots, etc.
Clean energy comes into play when you have a large enough factory. Large factories create a lot of pollution around the area, and this is visually represented by green water, dust clouds, and different ground textures. Pollution is an important mechanic as well, as it attracts enemies such as Biters and Spitters which will attempt to destroy the largest source of pollution nearby. This means that you need to create automated defense systems in the form of protective walls, and turrets that need to stay fed with ammunition.
This adds to the game as there is an extra layer of thought added to your factory expansion, and the threat of enemies is always looming.
