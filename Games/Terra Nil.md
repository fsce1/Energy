Terra Nil is a game set in the near future, where you are tasked with making earth back into a habitable enviroment after it has been destroyed by harvesting energy. You do this by placing structures that add life back to the world, such as irrigation and climate control tech. There is also a mechanic of biodiversity, so you need to have an equal amount of different biomes to keep the animals alive. At the end of the game, you need to pack up all of your structures and leave the planet. This is easier said than done as you need to use monorail connections and drones in order to do this.
I enjoyed this game, however there was a lot going on and the tutorial was quite condensed and taught you a lot very quickly.
While it's a fun puzzle game, i think it may have too many mechanics and different things to think about. it can get confusing pretty quick. There were also some redundant features that didnt add to the gameplay much, such as the stored energy mechanic. It is meant to limit how many objects you can place down, but there are already mechanics to do that, and it didnt add much to the game as a whole.
My favourite part was the graphics. It used a large contrast between the environment to show where live was flourishing, and where it was still dead and barren.
