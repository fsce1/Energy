# Overview/Pitch
Energy is an Isometric, tile-based strategy game in which you have to adapt to an increasing energy demand by building green energy solutions and searching the environment.
# Mechanics
You begin with a 16x16 grid, with different wind speeds, daylight hours, and geothermal readings. You have to find the perfect place to locate each structure to make the most energy possible.
You have a base energy demand that you must meet, and any additional energy created can be exported for money.
Money allows you to increase the map size, as well as increase the power that any specific structure can output.

# Visual Style
Since it will be a 3D game, I need a relatively fast and convienient way to create models for the game. If I went for realism, I would probably take lots of time that I could spend on more important things. Therefore, I will go with low-poly modelling.
