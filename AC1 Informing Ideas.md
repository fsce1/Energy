# Response to Brief
The Brief has asked me for a digital animation, game or experience that promotes energy conservation and the awareness of energy consumption. It is for all/any ages, and must be completed in a game engine such as Unity or Unreal.
While I have experience in both Unity and Unreal, I will be using Unity 3D for this project, as I personally prefer C#, as opposed to Unreal's Blueprint system or C++. It also provides a lot more tools for lo-poly models as it has a lot more downloadable packs on the Unity Asset Store.
My initial idea was a tycoon/builder game which encourages learning statistics and facts about green energy solutions such as wind turbines, and needs strategic thinking to place energy sources in the correct position. This will allow my game to satisfy older demographics, as it requires strategic thinking and tactics.

## Facts about climate change
- https://climate-change.data.gov.uk/
- The average temperature in the UK has increased by 1 degree centigrade since 1980
- The use of carbon-based fuels has gone down from 215.86 Mtoe to 134.84 Mtoe since 1990
## What has E.ON been doing to help?

- They have started using their Building energy Management Systems (BeMS) and Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This reduced M&S' energy consumption by 34%.
E.ON has also been attempting to decrease energy usage in homes. They sell solar panels to home-owners as well as businesses, and teach people about ways to decrease your energy usage in a smart way (I.E. using insulation, energy efficient boilers.)
They also provide a supply of 100% renewable electricity through E.ON Next, for businesses as well as homes.
E.ON specifically are supplying EV charging solutions, to help increase the usage of electric vehicles. They are also partnering with Nissan to invest in V2G, which allows energy to be transferred to nearby buildings from EV batteries.

## Some more facts about green energy
- 1 Wind Turbine is able to produce over 843,000 kWh per month of energy, enough for over 940 average US homes.

- The average single solar panel outputs 170-350 watts every hour, assuming 5 hours of direct sunlight. This works out to about 0.17 kWh to 0.35 kWh per solar panel.
