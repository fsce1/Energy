To begin I generated some ideas that take inspiration from the games I researched in the [[AC1 Informing Ideas]]. I wanted to take the parts of each game that I enjoyed, while trying to fix the issues I had with them.
# Game Ideas
## Idea 1:
- Sandbox game, similar to Factorio.
- Auto-building city every interval, increasing energy demands and game difficulty
- You need to build energy infrastructure and plants in order to supply energy around the city.

## Idea 2:
- simple tile-based building game in which you create a power grid
- increasing energy demands over time
- playing within a space constraint that expands by selling excess energy for money
- Ideal placements of wind, solar panels, etc. based on each tiles wind speed, sunlight hours, etc.
