To begin, I generated some ideas that take inspiration from the games I researched in the [[AC1 Informing Ideas]]. I wanted to take the parts of each game that I enjoyed, while trying to fix the issues I had with them.
# Game Ideas
## Idea 1:
- Sandbox game, similar to Factorio.
- Auto-building city every interval, increasing energy demands and game difficulty
- You need to build energy infrastructure and plants in order to supply energy around the city.
- Meanwhile keeping the inner city non-polluted and green.
- Difficulty of the game will be trying to keep energy demand satisfied, while keeping infrastructure and energy-creating structures away from the center of the city.
## Idea 2:
- simple tile-based building game in which you create a power grid
- increasing energy demands over time
- playing within a space constraint that expands by selling excess energy for money
- Each tile has a unique statistic for price, wind speed and sunlight hours. This means you need to strategize and find the perfect place for building each structure / wire.
## Idea 3:
- Nuclear Reactor Simulator
- Model of a nuclear reactor, in which you have to keep the reactor in a power-generating state.
- Helps teach about the operation of nuclear reactors and how they work on a technical level.
## Evaluation
Game 1 was interesting, although I think it would take much longer to create. It also needs to take into account many statistics, such as population happiness, energy output, and money. I feel it would get hard to visualise these statistics, especially population happiness. I would also have to figure out how to auto-build the city, which I think may get confusing as players might not understand what is happening.
Game 3 was a good idea, however as I started researching it, it became obvious that it would be much more complicated than i was originally thinking of. There are lots of complex mechanics and relationships between variables, and I havent been able to find a very good resource to learn exactly what all these rules are.
I chose to pursue Game 2, as it seems like a more simple version of Game 1. It has good potential as an endless game, as the map can keep expanding, and a fair bit of strategy as you need to select the optimal location for every tile.
